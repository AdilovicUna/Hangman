# Hangman

Simple and customizable hangman game where you can either input your word or it will be randomly chosen for you. You can indicate the difficulty, whether the word will be a noun, vowel, or adjective, and how many letters you want your opponent to see at the start of the game.
It is also possible to change the background.
All of your options are saved and reloaded the next time you play.
